        <center><p><b>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</b></p></center>

        <h2>Python is -</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Interpreted</b> − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it.</li>
            <br><li><b>Interactive </b> − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
            <br><li><b>Object-Oriented</b> − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
            <br><li><b>Beginner's Language</b> − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide <br> range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>

            <li>
                It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
