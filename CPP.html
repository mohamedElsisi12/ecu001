            <dd><b>C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural,<br> object-oriented, and generic programming.</b></dd>
            <br><dd><b>C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.</b></dd>
            <br><dd><b>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey,as an enhancement to the <br>C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.</b></dd>
            <br><dd><b>C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.</b></dd>
            <br> <dd><b>Note − A programming language is said to use static typing when type checking is performed during compile-time as opposed<br> to run-time.</b></dd>

        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of 
        object-oriented development −</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Data hiding</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Standard Libraries</h2>
        <p>Standard C++ consists of three important parts −</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, 
            data types and literals, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating 
            files, strings, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods 
            manipulating data structures, etc.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
